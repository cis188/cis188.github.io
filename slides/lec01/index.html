----
## What is DevOps?

DevOps is the breaking down of the wall between Developers and Operations to allow more frequent and reliable feature shipping.

----
## Traditional model of deployment
1. Developers write code
2. Code gets thrown over to Ops
3. Ops deploys the code and handles its reliability

---
<!-- .slide: class="dense" -->
## Issues with this model

- Developers and Ops are enemies of each other
  - Ops has no buy-in on the features developers build
  - Developers has no buy-in on the reliability of their software
- New features are slow-to-deploy, often requiring extensive QA cycles
- When a crash happens in production, the people handling the crash aren't the ones familiar with the code!

---
## DevOps solutions

- Automated testing and deployment
- Easy deploy rollback
- Observability

----
## Course Goals

- Learn about DevOps philosophies
  - Covered in lecture
- Learn to implement such philosophies
  - Covered in lecture + homeworks

----

# Python

---
<!-- .slide: data-auto-animate -->
# Python

- Easy to learn
- Easy to read/write
- Wide library support

----

## Control Flow

```python [1|3|4|5-7|6|8-12]
import time

for i in range(1, 16):
    print(i)
    if i % 3 == 0 and i % 5 == 0:
        print(time.time())
        print("fizzbuzz")
    elif i % 3 == 0:
        print("fizz")
    elif i % 5 == 0:
        print("buzz")
```

---

```
$ python3 test.py

## Functions

```python[1|11|]
def get_buzz(i):
    if i % 3 == 0 and i % 5 == 0:
        return "fizzbuzz"
    elif i % 3 == 0:
        return "fizz"
    elif i % 5 == 0:
        return "buzz"
    return ""

for i in range(1, 16):
    print(str(i) + " " + get_buzz(i))
```

## Packaging
---
<!-- .slide: data-auto-animate -->
## Packaging

- Ensure consistent versions across everyone writing this software
- Ensure dependencies are version-compatible with each other

---
## Poetry

- Modern Python package manager
- Pulls from [PyPi](https://pypi.org/)
- Creates reproducible build environments

----
<!-- .slide: class="dense" -->
## Dependency vs. Lock File

- Dependency file - used to declare "acceptable versions" of packages
  - Human editable
  - `pyproject.toml` in Poetry
- Lock file - used to declare specific package versions
  - Autogenerated
  - `poetry.lock` in Poetry

----
## Poetry Example

TODO: add a trivial example of how to use poetry. This should probably be a live demo that's also recorded in the lecture notes.

----

- [Lab 0: Web Servers](/homeworks/hw0/) is out! Start early in case you can't get Poetry installed.
- Make sure to join [Piazza](TODO: link piazza)
- Meet some other students! TODO: groupme link or something but add note about collab policy
