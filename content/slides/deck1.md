## What is DevOps?

DevOps is the breaking down of the wall between Developers and Operations to allow more frequent and reliable feature shipping.

----
## Traditional model of deployment
1. Developers write code
2. Code gets thrown over to Ops
3. Ops deploys the code and handles its reliability

---
<!-- .slide: class="dense" -->
## Issues with this model

- Developers and Ops are enemies of each other
  - Ops has no buy-in on the features developers build
  - Developers has no buy-in on the reliability of their software
- New features are slow-to-deploy, often requiring extensive QA cycles
- When a crash happens in production, the people handling the crash aren't the ones familiar with the code!

---
## DevOps solutions

- Automated testing and deployment
- Easy deploy rollback
- Observability
