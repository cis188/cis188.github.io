Welcome to CIS 188: DevOps at the University of Pennsylvania!

## Course Description

In recent years, DevOps has become a popular philosophy for bridging the gap between code being merged and code being deployed, but what is DevOps? While every organization has its own interpretation, this course takes the stance that DevOps is the breaking down of the wall between Developers and Operations to allow more frequent and reliable feature shipping. Through a variety of automation-focused techniques, DevOps has the power to radically improve and streamline processes that in the past were manual and brittle.

In this course we will take a practical, hands-on look at DevOps and dive into some of the main tools of DevOps: automated testing, containerization, reproducibility, continuous integration, and continuous deployment. Throughout the semester we build toward an end-to-end pipeline that takes a webserver, packages it, and then deploys it to the cloud in a reliable and quickly-reproducible manner utilizing industry-leading technologies like Kubernetes and Docker. Evaluation is based on homework assignments and a final group project.
