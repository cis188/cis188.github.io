### What is DevOps?

Breaking down the wall between developers (people writing code) and operations (how the code is released and deployed into production reliably). Traditionally these have been two very separate teams, but that means that developers aren't motivated to make life easier for operations and operations isn't motivated to make life easier for developers. The key concept behind DevOps is that if these two teams can be symbiotic, everyone can benefit (especially the users if we accomplish shipping more features more reliably).

There are a few main DevOps solutions we will be focusing on in CIS 188:
  - Automated testing and deployment (we can easily ship new features with testing)
  - Easy deploy rollback (if something breaks we can revert quickly)
  - Observability (we know when something is wrong)

### Python

We'll be using Python for most of the development side of the DevOps solutions we cover in this course. It's easy to learn, there is wide library support, and it is common and well supported in the infrastructure space.

### Packaging

Writing code is useful, reusing code is useful++. Making sure that everyone has access to the right packages and is also using the correct version of that package is no easy task. We'll look at a couple of solutions for this throughout the course (take a look that the Poetry demo).

### HTTP

This is the protocol behind the web. The model is client/server where the client requests something from the server, and the server responds to that request with the desired result. The server will serve many clients. It's super important to us to understand how HTTP works. If we run into issues with our deployments, understanding how HTTP works to communicate over the web is going to be vital in addressing the problem.

### HTTP Request Components

We have four main components in any HTTP request:
 - Method: What do we want to do?
 - URL : Where are we sending the request?
 - Headers: Metadata about the request and how to handle it
 - Body: The data associated with the request

### HTTP Methods

There are a number of HTTP methods, but we will use primarily these four:
 - GET
   - No body
   - Idempotent (same request gets the same result)
   - URL parameters (http://youtube.com/?search=avatar)
   - Common use case is to retrieve the content of a webpage
 - POST
   - Has a body.
   - Will have side effects (posting a comment on a post)
   - Common use case is form submission (think user registration)
 - PUT
   - Puts the body onto the server
   - Idempotent
   - Common use case is file upload (profile picture)
 - DELETE
   - Deletes the resource at the given URL (assuming you have permissions)
   - Common use case is deleting a file (deleting your profile picture)

### HTTP URLs

A URL like `https://httpstat.us/200` has three components to it:
  - `https`: This is the protocol (how we communicate with the host)
  - `httpstat.us`: This is the host (the place we are communicating with)
  - `/200`: This is the path (what resource we want to access on the host)

### HTTP Headers

Headers pass metadata about the request. Here are some examples:
  - Authentication (include some header that verifies your identity)
  - Caching (we can have a header that saves the age of the request for caching purposes)
  - Conditionals (an example may be are you on mobile or browser?)
  - Cookies (Browser information that is passed to the HTTP server as a header)
  - Body info (is it in XML, JSON, or something else?)

## Demos

### Poetry

One reoccurring design pattern we see in DevOps is package managers. This is a tool that helps manage your program's dependencies. In other words, the package manager is in charge of keeping track of what packages your project needs to run correctly, and then downloading those packages in a way that makes it easy for your program to use this auxillary code.

We'll look at a few different package managers over the course of the semester. Node has one called NPM (Node Package Manager), Java has a package manager called Maven, and Python has a few offerings. Note that these package managers are all a little different because they work with different languages that all have different nuances. This is why we can't reuse package managers across languages.

The Python package manager we'll be using is called Poetry. Essentially, Poetry allows you to download certain Python libraries, then it creates a virtual python environment on your machine to run your code with the given libraries. So, why the virtual environment? The answer is that Python varies a lot from version to version (especially Python 2 compared to Python 3). The virtual environment ensures that you, your team of developers, and your production environment are all on the same version of Python. This way we can avoid any issues and bugs that may arise from code that's written to work on one version of Python actually being run with a different version of Python.

Now, let's get into how to actually use Poetry. First, make sure that you have Poetry installed on your machine, instructions for installation can be found [here](https://python-poetry.org/docs/).

Once you have Poetry installed, let's create a new project:

```
# Create a new folder called poetry_demo
$ mkdir poetry_demo
# Enter the new folder
$ cd poetry_demo
$ poetry init
```

Now Poetry will give you lots of options for how to initialize your project, just hit enter for all of them (Poetry will use the default setup which is fine for our purposes). Once you've finished, you'll see that there is a new file `pyproject.toml` in the directory, this is the file that stores the information we just initialized.

Next, let's add a dependency:

```
$ poetry add numpy
Creating virtualenv poetry-demo-KkU142w6-py3.9 in /Users/airbenderang/Library/Caches/pypoetry/virtualenvs
Using version ^1.19.5 for numpy

Updating dependencies
Resolving dependencies... (39.8s)

Writing lock file

Package operations: 1 install, 0 updates, 0 removals

  â€¢ Installing numpy (1.19.5)
```

Now, Poetry actually does two things here. It downloads NumPy, but before that it actually creates a virtual environment which we are going to use to run our Python code. If we wanted to use a deprecated version of Python (like Python 2) we could configure Poetry to setup the virtual environment so it runs an older release of Python. Again, you will see a new file in your directory, this is the `poetry.lock` file. It doesn't make much sense to humans, but the `poetry.lock` file tracks which packages your program depends on and the version number of those packages.

Finally, let's run some code on Poetry's virtual environment. There are two ways that you will run python programs with Poetry. The first is you can type `poetry run script.py` and this would run a Python script in the Poetry environment, but instead we will be opening a new shell that will have the Poetry virtual environment as our default Python environment:

```
$ poetry shell
Spawning shell within /Users/airbenderang/Library/Caches/pypoetry/virtualenvs/poetry-demo-KkU142w6-py3.9
$ . /Users/airbenderang/Library/Caches/pypoetry/virtualenvs/poetry-demo-KkU142w6-py3.9/bin/activate
# Open a new Python interactive terminal
$ python
Python 3.9.1 (default, Dec 24 2020, 16:53:18) 
[Clang 12.0.0 (clang-1200.0.32.28)] on darwin
Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
>>> import numpy as np
>>> x = np.array([[1,2],[3,4]])
>>> x
array([[1, 2],
       [3, 4]])
>>> y = np.linalg.inv(x)
>>> y
array([[-2. ,  1. ],
       [ 1.5, -0.5]])
>>> exit() # To leave the Python terminal
# Then exit again to leave the Poetry shell
$ exit
```

It looks like NumPy works! This means that Poetry has been properly able to manage our dependencies so that they are accessible when we run our Python code with Poetry. Now, let's make a simple Python file and have Poetry run it. Create a new file called `average.py` in the same directory as your `pyproject.toml` and `poetry.lock` and paste this code into it:
```
import sys
import numpy as np

if len(sys.argv) < 2:
    print("Not enough command line arguments")
    exit()

xs = []
try:
    for i in range(1, len(sys.argv)):
        xs.append(int(sys.argv[i]))
except:
    print("Command line arguments are not integers")
    exit()

print(np.average(np.asarray(xs)))
```
Now, we can run this in the virtual environment created by Poetry:
```
$ poetry run python average.py 1 2 3 4
2.5
```
Awesome, it looks like this is working, too. Try changing around the command line arguments!
