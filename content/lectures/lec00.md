## Administrativa

Welcome everyone!

An overview of the topics covered and grading policy can be found on the [syllabus page](/syllabus/). A (tentative) schedule for the course can be found on the [schedule page](/schedule/).

We will use piazza for course-related discussion and office hours will be held on Zoom. Links for office hours will be posted on piazza.

If you have any questions, check [the course website](https://cis188.github.io/), ask a question on piazza or come to office hours!

This is our first time teaching the course, so bear with us as we figure out what we're doing.

## About Us

## HTTP

Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) is the protocol the runs the web. Whenever you interact with a website, your browser (Google Chrome, Safari, Firefox, Netscape Navigator, etc) uses HTTP to communicate with that website.

HTTP follows the clientâ€“server model, which means that any number of clients (normally web browsers) can request resources from a server (the website you want to connect to).

HTTP will the the foundation of this course. We'll start by building an HTTP server in python, and then we'll learn how to package and deploy that server in a place where other people can interact with it.

### Components of an HTTP Request

The following make up the components of an HTTP request

1. Method - what type of action to perform

    Here's a table of a few of the most common method as well as some defining characteristics:

{{<table "table table-striped table-bordered">}}
| GET                                       | POST                      | PUT                                  | DELETE              |
| ----------------------------------------- | ------------------------- | ------------------------------------ | ------------------- |
| Has no body                               | Can use a body            | Uses a body                          | Deletes a resource  |
| Used for read-only operations             | Used to modify a resource | Used to create or replace a resource |                     |
| Uses Query parameters to hold information |                           | Is idempotent                        |                     |
| Is idempotent                             |                           |                                      |                     |
| Ex. Retrieving a webpage                  | Ex. Submitting a form     | Ex. Uploading a file                 | Ex. Deleting a file |
{{</table>}}

2. URL - specifices what resource to request

    For example: https://httpstat.us/200

    https:// - **Protocol** normally http or https (unencrypted or use TLS encryption).

    httpstat.us - **Hostname** the unique identifier of where to connect to.

    200 - **Path** What resource on the host to interact with.

3. Headers

    HTTP headers allow the client to attach additional information to their request. Some common headers are:
    * Authentication (`Authorization`)
    * Caching (`Ages`, `Expires`)
    * Cookies
    * Body information (`Content-Type`, `Content-Length`)

4. Body - data associated with the request

    Of the HTTP methods we've covered, a body is only used in POST and PUT.
    A body just consists of additional data that's sent as part of the request. This data is often a single file, form data, or a JSON object that the client sends to the server.

### HTTP Response components

TODO:

## Demos

### Browser

The most common way to interact with an HTTP server is through the browser -- this is something we all do everyday. Let's open up a new browser window and see if we can get any more information about the actual HTTP requests underlying the page we view.

Navigate to our course site: [cis188.github.io](https://cis188.github.io/), when we load the page lots of HTTP requests are fired off to retrieve everything that your browser is going to need to compile and load this page on your computer. We can actually examine these HTTP requests by right clicking on the window and selecting `inspect element` (on certain browsers, you might have to search through the help bar or configure your browser settings to allow developer tools). In your developer tool, you will be able to see a series of requests (normally under the `network` tab).

![browser_screenshot](/demos/browser_screenshot.png)

These are all HTTP requests that sent out by your browser. You can see the the duration of each request, the status code in the response, as well as the size and type of the response data. If you select a particular request, you can see the request and response headers (metadata passed alongside the actual data being transferred). All of this information can be helpful with debugging a website that is not loading or working as expected.

### cURL

cURL or Client URL is another way of viewing a response from a webserver as a client. Let's "cURL" the course website:
```
$ curl https://cis188.github.io/
```
this displays, as text, the actual HTML that your browser uses to render the website. Can we use cURL to see other browser resources?
```
$ curl https://cis188.github.io/img/logo.png > logo.png
```
here we are retrieving the course logo from the website. Because the logo is an image and the command cannot display images, we instead use the `>` symbol, called a redirect, to save the output to a file called `logo.png` in our working directly. If you use your computer's GUI to navigate to the terminal's current working directory, you will see this new file called `logo.png` and you can open it!

### HTTPie

HTTPie is a command-line tool that actually allows us to send specific HTTP requests. This is something you might not already have installed so checkout the download guide [here](https://httpie.io/docs#installation). Next, let's give it a try:
```
$ http GET https://cis188.github.io/
```
this command uses HTTPie to send a GET request to the course website. The response you get back should look almost identical to what you get if you cURL the course website, but with the addition of the response headers. This allows us to examine the resposne that the HTTP server is sending and if there are any mistakes or inconsistencies we can correct them.

We can also use HTTPie to specify the request headesr when we actually send a request to a website. In a sense, we can build our own HTTP request and send it off, instead of having the browser write the request specifcally for our needs. More specifically, we can specify what kind of request we are making (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, etc.) and we can add headers as decide the body of the request. You can see that if we try to send a POST request to the course page, we get an error:
```
$ http POST https://cis188.github.io/
```
this is because the HTTP server hosting our course website is only expect GET requests, it does not expect a user to be sending it data with a POST request.

Here's another example that queries a public weather API:
```
$ http GET api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/weather appid=ee5663bb9450273b46632b11e97ad6ad q=Philadelphia
```
here we are including in the request two parameters `appid=ee5663bb9450273b46632b11e97ad6ad` and `q=Philadelphia`, because this is a GET request these are included as URL parmeters, if we instead send a POST request we can include the `--form` tag so that HTTPie includes these paremeters in the post body. The first paremeter is just an API key that the course instructors generated ahead of time, but the second parameter you can change to see current weather updates anywhere on Earth!

### Postman

Postman is a tool much like HTTPie that allows us to send specific HTTP requests and closely examine the HTTP response, but it's implemented with a GUI that makes the process a little more intuitive. Let's create a new request in the Postman GUI that calls a GET to the course page:

![postman_body_screenshot](/demos/postman_body_screenshot.png)

Here we can see the request we created at the top of the page, as well as the body of the response from the HTTP server at the bottom of the page. If we tab over we can also see the headers that are included in the response:

![postman_headers_screenshot](/demos/postman_headers_screenshot.png)

Like HTTPie, Postman will let us specify URL parameters, headers, cookies (additonal data typically handled by your browser), as well as the time it took for the server to response and the size of the response. If we instead get the course logo, we can see that the size of the response is much larger because it contains the image data:

![postman_logo_screenshot](/demos/postman_logo_screenshot.png)

The other benefit of Postman is that it allows you to save reqeusts that you use typically, so if you often find yourself sending a certain request to check if a page is functioning correctly, you can avoid having to recreate that request every time you need to do that check. You can also create custom tests which you run from Postman to ensure that your are getting the responses you are expecting.

Let's use Postman to query the weather API that we examined in the HTTPie demo:

![postman_weather_screenshot](/demos/postman_weather_screenshot.png)

We've specified the two parameters in the `Params` tab, and you can see at the top of the page that Postman automatically modifies the request URL to include these as URL parameters. The response is automically prettified and displayed as JSON, but Postman can also show you the raw text response or can display it in HTML. You can also tab over and examine the response headers. Lastly, you can save the entire HTTP response to a file if you wanted to hold onto it.

For including parameters in POST requests with Postman, the process is a little more complicated. Instead of putting them in the `Params` tab, you'll click on `Body` and then on the `form-data` button. This allows you to include your parameters in the POST body which is the norm when sending POST reqeusts.
